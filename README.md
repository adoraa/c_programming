The repository consists of two directories:

1. (Ritchie-C): [This folder contains exercises based on the book "The C Programming Language (2nd Edition)" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. These exercises are designed to deepen your understanding of C programming.]

2. (Tony-C): [Inside this directory, you'll find exercises based on the book "Sams Teach Yourself C in 24 Hours" by Tony Zhang and John Southmayd (2000). These exercises further develop your C programming skills within a structured learning framework.]

These folders provide a valuable resource for learning and practicing C programming, allowing you to work through exercises from two different perspectives.
